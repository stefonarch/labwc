# NAME

labwc - theme files

# THEME

The theme engine aims to be compatible with openbox and themes will be
searched for in the following order:

- ${XDG_DATA_HOME:-$HOME/.local/share}/themes/<theme-name>/openbox-3/
- $HOME/.themes/<theme-name>/openbox-3/
- /usr/share/themes/<theme-name>/openbox-3/
- /usr/local/share/themes/<theme-name>/openbox-3/
- /opt/share/themes/<theme-name>/openbox-3/

Choosing a theme is done by editing the <name> key in the <theme> section of
the rc.xml configuration file (labwc-config(5)).

A theme consists of a themerc file and optionally some titlebar icons (referred
to as buttons).

Theme settings specified in themerc can be overridden by creating a
'themerc-override' file in the configuration directory, which is normally
$HOME/.config/labwc/ but can be a few other locations as described in
labwc-config(5).

Note: The button elements (i.e. window.[in]active.button.\*) support defining
different types of buttons individually by inserting the type ("menu", "iconify", "max"
and "close") after the button node. For example:
window.active.button.iconify.unpressed.image.color

# BUTTONS

The images used for the titlebar icons are referred to as buttons.

The image formats listed below are supported. They are listed in order of
precedence, where the first format in the list is searched for first.

- png
- svg
- xbm

By default, buttons are 1-bit xbm (X Bitmaps). These are masks where 0=clear and
1=colored. The xbm image files are placed in the same directory as the themerc
file within a particular theme. The following xbm buttons are supported:

- max.xbm
- iconify.xbm
- close.xbm
- menu.xbm

One advantage of xbm buttons over other formats is that they change color based
on the theme. Other formats use the suffices "-active" and "-inactive" to align
with the respective titlebar colors. For example: "close-active.png"

# DEFINITIONS

The handle is the window edge decoration at the bottom of the window.

# DERIVED DIMENSIONS

The window title bar height is equal to the vertical font extents of the title and twice the padding.height
Padding will be added to this later.
